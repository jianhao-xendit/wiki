 Welcome to the **Exclusive Networks** Threat Hunting Training, this is the official lab guide that will guide you through performing attacker TTP's, building detections, dashboards and defenses.

 >We will go through part of the kill chain, explain how the attacks work, then build detections and talk a bit about preventive measures.
