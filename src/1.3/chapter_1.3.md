CHAPTER 1.3: Installing MDBOOK and Wiki Instructions
====

>This chapter explains how to install the Threat Hunting WIKI and Labs guide, if you want to run a local version

On your kali linux machine open a terminal. Use SSH and login with your kali username and password (***kali/kali***). First we're going to clone the MarkDown files from the wiki to our local machine> Then we'll clone the ThreatHunt github repository that contains all the labs and docker containers.

***Source: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook***

```code
 ssh kali@yourkalimachine
``` 

 ```code
 cd /opt
 sudo git clone https://github.com/crimsoncore/wiki.git
 sudo git clone https://gitlab.com/Schoonaert/threathunt.git
```
You should see the following structure for the MarkDown files:

Install **mdbook** (if you want to run this locally on your Kali machine) - in the Lab environment you can simple connect to the ELK server (10.0.0.5) on port 3000, as we have already pre-installed this.

Navigate to the folder where you cloned the wiki.git repository, in the example above this is the /opt/wiki directory ($PWD).

```code
cd /opt/wiki
sudo docker run -it --name mdbook -v $PWD:/opt/wiki -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 crimsoncorelabs/mdbook
```

> If you're doing this on MacOS it's better to clone the repo to a default shared directory by your docker-desktop client. The __"/opt" directory__ is not supported on a Mac, so it's better to do this from your ?/Users/youruser (or ~ home directory).

MDbook will automatically monitor for new updates, so you can pull down new versions of the documentation whenever available by going to the directory where you cloned the repository:

```code
cd /opt/wiki
sudo git pull
```

> We also provided docker compose files, which you can find in the /opt/threathunt/docker-compose directory. You can install docker compose files like this (make sure you run this command from ***the directory your wiki is cloned*** into i.e. /Users/Student01/wiki or /opt/wiki):

```code
cd /opt/wiki
sudo docker-compose -f /opt/threathunt/docker-compose/docker-compose.mdbook.yml up -d
```
- -f : the name of the docker-compose name
- -d : run in daemon mode

**Source: /opt/threathunt/docker-compose/dc.mdbook.yml**
```yml
version: '2'
services:
  mdbook:
    image: crimsoncorelabs/mdbook
    container_name: mdbook
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
    - $PWD:/opt/wiki
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    networks:
      - elastic
